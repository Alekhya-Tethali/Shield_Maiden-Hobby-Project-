# Shield_Maiden

A two-dimensional platform game where the girl(avatar), the Princess of the Kingdom of Light, has to fight the monsters in each level, collect keys and coins to be able to open the door at the end of the level and enter the next level. The game constitutes 3 levels. The character is initially given 5 lives to complete the 3 levels. If the avatar comes in contact with the enemy or gets hit by the enemy, she will lose a life. If all the five lives are over, the game is over!

A virtual canvas os set up in the Java Eclipse IDE to display the backgrounds and let the avatar move around.
The avatar is designed using MS Paint and LunaPic Online Photo Editor.
In each level there are a series of platforms that are built using a TileMap Editor.
The animations, movements of the character, collisions with the enemies and their fireballs, etc. are all coded in Java programming language.
